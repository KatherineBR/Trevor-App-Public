# trevor-app

This is a Flutter project created by T4SG S25 for The Trevor Project.

## Building the App

1. Setup Flutter for your desired target device (can add more later): https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install.
2. Setup your IDE for Flutter (optional, if not used to install SDK) 
   a. For VSCode:
      i. install the Flutter by Dart Code extension
3. Connect a device
   a. If you do not have a device, you can use an XCode (iOS) or Android Studio (Android) emulator
   b. If you are downloading Android Studio for the first time, you must configure your android development (make sure to download command line tools)
4. Check setup by running "flutter doctor" in terminal (should get green checks for desired targets)
5. Clone this repository
6. Start the device/emulator
7. Execute "flutter run" in this repository's folder (this will automatically run in debug mode)
